                <h1>Assignment 1: 30MMF Video</h1><br>
                <p>For this assignment, I shot a short video about my morning before coming to Communications Lab Class. <br>
                    I edited the video using Adobe Premier Pro. <br><br>
                    Although I tried to stabilize it both while filming and during editing, 
                    since I moved the camera around a lot to avoid filming people, it was quite hard to 
                    achieve the desired effect.
